I created this project because I wanted a new portfolio site, and wanted to learn React. This project was my first foray into React, and was initially created as a way to learn/practice the library. I recognize that there's *a lot* that could be improved, code-wise, but style-wise, I'm happy with the final result. And I learned a lot about React, which was the ultimate goal.
